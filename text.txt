How are you doing today!

I am doing great today. I hope all is well with you. I created this text editor and it has lead to some
interesting problems. Its almost complete. I just want to implement undo and redo functionality.
Afterwards, I would like to then make a lexer to have better text hightlighting.

Things are working!!!!
